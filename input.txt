City officials unveiled a twelve-month pilot to redesign downtown streets with protected bike lanes, expanded sidewalks, and priority bus corridors. The plan allocates $18 million from the transportation budget and leverages federal grants to modernize signals and curbside management. Supporters argue the redesign will cut travel times for buses by up to 15% and improve safety at historically dangerous intersections. Small business owners worry about reduced street parking and delivery access during construction. In response, the city proposed off-peak loading zones, a digital permit system for couriers, and wayfinding to nearby garages.

The pilot will launch in phases, starting with three corridors where crash data is highest. Sensors will track speeds, near-misses, and ridership, while a public dashboard reports progress every month. The climate office estimates the project could avoid thousands of car trips weekly if paired with discounted transit passes from major employers. A community advisory group will meet quarterly to review data and adjust the design. If metrics show improved safety and reliable travel times without harming retail sales, the council will vote next year to make the changes permanent and extend them to adjacent neighborhoods.
